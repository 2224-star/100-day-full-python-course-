# Day_07 python programming with Operators
# in python operators are special symbols or keywords that used to perform operation on variables and values here's an overview of the differnet types of oerators in python 
# Arithmetic Operators 
# used to perform mathematical Operations 
# + addition
# - subtration
# * multiplication
# / division
# % modulus
# ** exponentiation
# // floor division
# Example of mathematical operations
# add Two Number
a = 10
b= 39
print("addition of a and b is ", a+b)
# - subtration
print("Subraction the two number is ",a-b)
# * multiplication
print("Multiplication of a two number is ",a*b)
# /division
print("Division of a two number is ",a/b)
# % modulus
print ("modulus of a and b is ",a%b)
print("floor division of two numner is ",a//b)
# ** expinentiation
print("Exponentiation of a and b is ",a**b)
